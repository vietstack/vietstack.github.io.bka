" I'm working with Database-As-A-Service project (Trove) of Openstack, I followed docs at docs.openstack.org. After getting failed 2-3 times, I have decided to try with another guide. I goodle-ed and realised that there is no working tutorial on the Internet. So now I am writing this article to provide step-by-step installation guide to get Openstack Trove working (at least It was working in my LAB :lol:) "

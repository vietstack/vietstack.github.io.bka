Todo: Install Devstack with Ceph configuration running inside.
<ol>
	<li>Create openrc file with Ceph configuration.</li>
	<li>Install Devstack environment with 1 controller, minimum 1 compute and 2 Ceph node.</li>
	<li>Play with Ceph:D. Kill one Ceph node and see how the another behaves (HA problem).</li>
</ol>
